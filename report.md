## Understanding the ReComposer report

- The system report generated by Laravel ReComposer is a detailed file in the markdown format containing the Laravel & Server Environment details both of your laravel app which can help you in troubleshooting.
- Along with the Laravel & Server environment details, Laravel ReComposer report
 also shows whether the [required configurations](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4#installation) by Laravel are implemented or not in your environment.
- Suppose suddenly or after some changes your app broke, you can install Laravel ReComposer, generate & copy the report and paste it in the issue box of the respective repo you are reporting the issue to.
- The issue might be because of a specific package or laravel in your specific dev environment. This report gives all the info required at once to the respective package developer who is working on resolving the issue to know the environment you are working in, that might help in recreating the issue.
- For package/laravel app developers this can be very useful when collecting the information from the users reporting the issues.
- This report can be easily copied by clicking the copy report button.
- The format is Markdown because the aim of the report is to quickly send over the laravel & server environment details from the user to the issue box of the repo making available the details in a neat markdown format to the respective developer.
